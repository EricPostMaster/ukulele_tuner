# Lexi's Ukulele Tuner

## How It Started
My niece has a ukulele and has asked me on multiple occasions if I can help her tune it, which I'm happy to do, but I thought it would be fun to make an app that would help her tune her ukulele herself.

Also, I love using ChatGPT to make web applications. I've been curious to see how much heavy lifting ChatGPT can do, so I decided this would be a fun use case to see if I could get it to write pretty much all the code based in my prompts, even if I knew how to make a change myself.

## How It's Going
Here is my initial prompt:

```plaintext
You and I are developing a new progressive web app. It is an application for tuning a ukulele using the microphone in your computer, tablet, or smart phone. The app is geared toward fifth grade students who are learning to play the ukulele, so it needs to be very easy to use.

Here are the main requirements:
- Simple design
- It needs to work in the browser on Windows desktop as well as on iPad and iPhone.
- Allow the user to select the string they want to tune, preferably with an image of an ukulele so they can clearly see which note they are tuning.
- A signal bar or dial showing how sharp or flat a note is.
- A letter above the signal bar/dial showing the target note, such as G, C, E, or A

Please produce the code required to make this app
